HLA-B27 Molecular Mimicry Study — MD Simulation & Analysis
📘 Project Overview
•	This repository documents a complete computational workflow to identify Klebsiella pneumoniae–derived peptides that mimic a human Annexin peptide (ANX) in binding to HLA-B27:05, a Class-I MHC associated with autoimmune diseases such as Ankylosing Spondylitis.
•	The objective is to investigate whether microbial peptides can:
•	Bind HLA-B27 in a similar way as human peptides.
•	Form stable structural interactions.
•	Exhibit comparable post-MD behavior.
•	Supporting a potential molecular mimicry mechanism.
________________________________________
•	I focused on learning:
•	Peptide generation and filtering
•	HLA-B27 binding predictions
•	Sequence similarity and mimicry search
•	Peptide docking and molecular dynamics (MD)
•	Trajectory analysis (RMSD, RMSF, SASA, PCA, MMGBSA

•	🛠️## Overview of the Pipeline
•	Generate peptides from human Annexin (anx) and full K. pneumoniae (kp)proteome
•	HLA-B27 binding prediction using NetMHCpan
•	Sequence similarity & mimic scoring
•	Docking using AlphaFold-Multimer
•	Structure optimization with AmberTools23 (tleap)
•	Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation in GROMACS 2024.
•	Post-process trajectories (centering, frame skipping, fitting)
•	Post-MD analysis: RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, H-bonds, MM-GBSA
•	Identification of strongest microbial mimic

•	📘 ## Reproducibility Note
•	project was created for learning purposes. The scripts were developed through trial and error and are not fully automated, so the workflow may not be fully reproducible.The scripts are shared mainly to illustrate the approach and my learning process, not as a polished, production-ready workflow.
