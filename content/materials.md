# Software / Tools
The following software and tools were used at different stages of the workflow:

**1. Python 3.10+ / Biopython:** 

Used for peptide generation, FASTA handling, and sequence-based analyses.

**2. NetMHCpan:**

Employed to predict binding affinity of peptides to HLA-B27:05.

**3. BLAST / Bio.Align:**

Used for sequence similarity searches and alignment-based mimicry screen>

**4. AlphaFold / HADDOCK:**

Applied for structural modeling and docking of peptide–HLA complexes.

**5. AmberTools23:**

Used for structure preparation, protonation, force-field assignment, and>

**6. GROMACS 2024**

Used for molecular dynamics simulations and trajectory correction and analysis.

**6. gmx_MMPBSA:**
