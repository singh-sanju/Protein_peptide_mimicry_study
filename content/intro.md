# Introduction

This book documents a computational study on peptide molecular mimicry
between human Annexin peptides and Klebsiella pneumoniae–derived peptides
binding to HLA-B27:05.

The goal is to investigate whether microbial peptides can structurally
and energetically resemble human peptides and potentially trigger
autoimmune T-cell activation via molecular mimicry.
