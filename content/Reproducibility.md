# Reproducibility Note

This project was developed mainly for learning and exploratory purposes. The computational workflow and scripts were created through trial and error, with several manual adjustments, and therefore are not fully automated. The scripts are shared to demonstrate the overall approach and my learning process, rather than as a finalized or production-ready workflow. As a result, the complete workflow may require additional adjustments to be fully reproducible.
