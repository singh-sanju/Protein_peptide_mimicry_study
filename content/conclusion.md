# Conclusion

## Summary of Findings
The MD simulation results suggest that kp1 is the most likely microbial
peptide to structurally and dynamically mimic the self-peptide anx.
This resemblance supports the hypothesis that kp1 may participate in
molecular mimicry mechanisms, potentially contributing to immune
cross-reactivity in HLA-B27-associated conditions.

## Limitations and Future Work

These findings provide a computational basis for further investigation
of kp1 in the context of HLA-B27-associated immune cross-reactivity.
However, additional studies involving structural superposition and
immunogenicity prediction are required to confirm functional mimicry.
