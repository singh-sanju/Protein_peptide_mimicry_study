# Conclusion

## Summary of Findings
The MD simulation results suggest that kp1 is the most likely microbial
peptide to structurally and dynamically mimic the self-peptide anx.
This resemblance supports the hypothesis that kp1 may participate in
molecular mimicry mechanisms, potentially contributing to immune
cross-reactivity in HLA-B27-associated conditions.


## Limitations and Future Work

Due to the limited number of peptides analyzed, the findings of this study
are preliminary. Future work will focus on expanding the peptide dataset
to enable systematic screening and the application of machine learning
approaches for identifying molecular mimicry patterns. In addition,
structural superposition and immunogenicity prediction will be required
to confirm functional mimicry in the context of HLA-B27-associated
immune cross-reactivity.
