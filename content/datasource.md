## Data Sources

### Human Protein

Annexin (ANX)
Annexins are host proteins involved in membrane dynamics and immune processes. A peptide derived from Annexin was selected as the reference self-peptide for mimicry analysis.

### Microbial Source

Klebsiella pneumoniae proteome
K. pneumoniae has been frequently associated with ankylosing spondylitis and other HLA-B27–linked autoimmune conditions. Its complete proteome was therefore chosen as the microbial peptide source.

Only FASTA sequences were used at this stage to avoid structural bias.

## Peptide Generation and Extraction

Peptide identification was performed in two sequential steps:

1_Peptide slicing

2_Peptide filtering and mimicry screening

This two-step approach allows generation of a broad peptide pool followed by biologically informed reduction.
