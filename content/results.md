## Stability of HLA–Peptide Complexes

RMSD and Rg trends observed

Human vs microbial complexes compared

Mention relative stability (not numbers if you don’t want)

The HLA–ANX complex remained structurally stable throughout the simulation, while microbial peptide complexes exhibited varying degrees of deviation.

## Structural Comparison of Human vs Microbial Peptides

RMSF differences

Flexible vs rigid regions

Peptide positioning in binding groove 

## Binding Energy Comparison

## Identification of Strongest Mimic Peptide
