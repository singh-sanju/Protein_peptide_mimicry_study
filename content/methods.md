# Methods

This section describes the computational strategy used to identify and characterize microbial peptide candidates capable of mimicking a human self-peptide in binding to HLA-B27:05. 

The workflow consists of five major stages:

1. **Data Preparation**, including:

   - a.  Selection of data sources  

   - b. Peptide generation and extraction, comprising:
     -  i. Peptide slicing  
     - ii. Peptide filtering and molecular mimicry screening  

2. **Molecular Docking and Selection of Peptides**

3. **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**

4. **Post-Trajectory Correction and Processing**

5. **Post-MD Trajectory Analysis**

The overview of the Pipeline is shown in {numref}`fig_workflow` and the detailed methods are presented in the next part.
