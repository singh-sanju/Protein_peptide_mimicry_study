# Analysis

## RMSD Analysis

RMSD used to assess structural stability

Calculated for HLA–peptide complexes

Time-dependent deviation from starting structure

Comparison between human and microbial complexes

## RMSF Analysis

RMSF measures residue-level flexibility

Calculated for backbone atoms

Identification of flexible regions

Comparison across complexes

## Radius of Gyration

Rg used to assess compactness

Indicates folding stability

Changes monitored over simulation time

## SASA Analysis

SASA measures solvent exposure

Reflects burial/exposure of peptide

Compared between complexes

## Hydrogen Bond Analysis

Number of hydrogen bonds monitored

HLA–peptide interactions

Indicator of binding stability

## MM-GBSA Binding Free Energy

Post-MD free energy estimation

MM-GBSA methodology

Used to compare relative binding strength
